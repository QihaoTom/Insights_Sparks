* 1.How can we induce people to look after their health?

* 2.How do societies create effective and resilient institutions, such as governments?

* 3.How do we reduce the 'skill gap' between black and white people in America?

* 4.How can we aggregate information possessed by individuals to make the best decisions?

* 5.How can we understand the human capacity to create and articulate knowledge?

* 6.Why do so many female workers still earn less than male workers?

* 7.How and why does the 'social' become 'biological'?

* 8.How can we be robust against 'black swans' -- rate events that have extreme consequence?

* 9.How can humanity increase its collective wisdom?

* 10.Why do social processes, in particular civil violence, either persist over time or suddenly change?
